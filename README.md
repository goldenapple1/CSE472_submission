## Disclaimer

I am not responsible if you lose points because you didn't check if the script included all the files

## Usage

put the script under solution directory (where 3 files exist, project folder, grading file, .sln solution file), and click run

it should not delete any of your file during running, it only put the resource and code file into the zip

## Requirement

python >= 3.6
I guess I don't need to tell you how to install python, right?
