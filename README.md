## Disclaimer

I am not responsible if you lose points because you didn't check if the script included all the files

## Usage

put the script under solution directory (where 3 files exist, project folder, grading file, .sln solution file), and click run

## Requirement

python >= 3.6
I guess I don't need to tell you how to install python, right?
